## 🚀 Introduction

In this repository you can find the files generated in the **30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge - Project 04** within **[Wes Bos Courses](https://courses.wesbos.com/)**.

The aim of this project is to **solve 8 exercises using** the different **array methods**.

## 👾 Description 

**Sweat it out!**

In this repository you will find a series of **exercises to solve** them **using** different **array methods**, being these:
- **filter**.
- **map**.
- **sort**.
- **reduce**. 
## 📝 Requirements

The exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **JS**

## 🛠️ Tools

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **GIT version control**
- **JS**
  - querySelector()
  - querySelectorAll()
  - filter
  - map
  - sort
  - reduce

## 📖 What have I learned?

#### **filter**

The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

#### **map**

The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

#### **sort**

The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

The time and space complexity of the sort cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the implementation.

#### **reduce**

The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

The first time that the callback is run there is no "return value of the previous calculation". If supplied, an initial value may be used in its place. Otherwise the array element at index 0 is used as the initial value and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.
